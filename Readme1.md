1) creating a trial account was without a problem
2) By setting up the Dancing goat I encountered severel issues:
   
   deprecated har-validator@5.1.5: this library is no longer supported

Lack of package-lock.json file or har-validator@5.1.5 is in this file;
Solution
Delete package-lock.json and execute
npm install to rewrite!


3) Adding article to the project was without problem

4) I encountered several technical issues, but I always googled the solution (dancing goat site was not showing etc.) 
   I learned more about kontent.ai app, I learned what to do when encountering issues in terminal, I learned how to work with git
